It was Feb 28, 2099 when a catastrophic world war completely changed human's life, and it must be a day for all human to remember; while for Steve, this was the last day for him, a freshman who just passed his 19th birthday, to see his familiar world again. At the moment when his optimistic and promising future was replaced by piles of dismal and hopeless relics, he was destined to live in the law of jungle in a refuge.

Fear, the only feeling Steve was accustomed to, no happiness no joy only fear ruled his life ever since that fateful day. Turmoil had ruled world politics 
for years, until finally one day all hell broke lose. Tensions between The US and Russia were at there highest since the cold war. It was a normal run of
the mill day on the 28th, it was monday, and Steve crawled out of bed to take a shower, he was off to clas, he had a Compute Science lecture to attend.
When he arrived he found an empty seat and began to get out his materials, when suddenly a cacophony of screaming phones erupted in the nearly filled 
lecture hall. Franctically he pulled out his own phone, he let a gasp out of his lips, and a few screams were heard, as steve looked up he saw the same
fearful look on each and everyone one of his classmates faces, he looked back down once again to read, "Ballistic missiles inbound to your location, seek
Shelter immediatly."
